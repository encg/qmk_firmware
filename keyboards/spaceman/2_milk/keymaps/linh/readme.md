# encg's Keymap

## What is this?

Update of [my keymap](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/spaceman/2_milk/keymaps/encg) with the following changes:

- [ ] Factor in emoji hierarchy into RNG algorithm
- [ ] Random/Wildcard emoji
- [ ] Keep a count for winng combinations
- [ ] Implement tap dance for easily switching unicode input types
- [ ] Output and delete emojis rapidly to further simulate scrolling/slots feel (Thanks PHT)
